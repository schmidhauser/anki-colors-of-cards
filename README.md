# Colours of Marked, Suspended, and Flagged Cards

As its name suggests, this little addon allows one to change the standard background-colours of cards that are marked, suspended, or equipped with either flag1, flag2, flag3, or flag4.

To configure, proceed as follows:
<ol><li>Go to the initial <b>Decks</b> screen.</li><li>Click on <b>Tools &gt; Add-Ons</b> (or press <b>⇧⌘A</b>).</li><li>Select <b>Colours of Marked, Suspended, and Flagged Cards</b>.</li><li>Select <b>View Files</b> on the lower right side.</li><li>Open the file <b>colours_of_cards․py</b> with a text editor.</li><li>Choose the desired colours.</li></ol>The six colours in question can be specified by using hexadecimal numerals or one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#X11_color_names" rel="nofollow">the standard colour names</a>.

<p>

Upon install, there is only one immediately noticeable change: marked cards appear no longer in grey (<code>#cccccc</code>) – which made it difficult to distinguish them from selected cards, painted in dark grey – but in lavender (<code>#e6e6fa</code>).
